   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not a good student.  I’m currently sitting in class writing a post rather than taking notes.  Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love playing board games and word games.  That’s why I started posting again.  I want to start logging my ideas and taking more action in developing games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in education and how it shapes our world.  I’m married to a kindergarten teacher.  I work as a SE for at a non-profit MOOC platform.  I started an ed-tech startup (it failed, but I started it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of ideas, but more and more I have been interested in the idea of building games.  Games and play are an important part of how I enjoy spending my time, but also how I believe humans are primed for learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to explore how the things I care about most can be applied together.  I don’t know where this journey will take me, but I’m excited to start giving more life to these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
